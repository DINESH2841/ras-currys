### 2. **Product Management**
**Admin → Products**

#### Bulk Create (AI-Assisted)
- **Input Format**: Paste lines like `Pappu - 25`, `Chicken Curry - 60`, `Egg fry - 30`.
- **Auto-Parsing**:
  - Strips currency symbols (`₹`, `INR`), numbers, and separators (`-`, `:`).
  - Extracts name and price automatically.
- **Category Detection**: Auto-detects "Pickles" if name contains `pickle/achar/chutney`; otherwise sets to "Currys".
- **Description Generation**:
  - Uses **Gemini AI** (if `VITE_API_KEY` is set) to generate appetizing 1-sentence descriptions.
  - Fallback template: `"[Name] — a delicious Indian curry with aromatic spices and rich, home-style flavors."` when API unavailable.
- **Image Generation**:
  - Uses **LoremFlickr** with deterministic name-based lock: `https://loremflickr.com/400/300/indian,food,curry,{name}?lock={hash}`.
  - Validates image URL before saving; falls back to seeded **Picsum**: `https://picsum.photos/seed/{name}/400/300`.
  - Stored as **data URLs** (base64) to avoid exposing external links.

#### Single Product Add

- **Save**: Updates product in real-time via `db.updateProduct()`.

#### Remove Listed Products

- Click **"Remove Listed Products"** to delete matching items.
- Confirmation required before deletion.

#### Product Display
- **Thumbnail**: 10×10px circular image with fallback `onError` handler.
